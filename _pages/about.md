About
======

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the University of Notre Dame, where I am advised by Dr. Danny Chen. My research focuses on developing novel methods using Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Self-supervised Learning, and Graph Techniques to tackle challenges in Medical Image Analysis and build robust, automated, and data-efficient healthcare tools. I received my M.S. in CSE from the University of Notre Dame and my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Southern Mississippi.

I am currently searching for 2025 summer internships. 😊
