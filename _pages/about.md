About
======

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, advised by Dr. Danny Chen. My research in AI for healthcare and medical image analysis spans self-supervised foundation models, data-efficient 3D segmentation, multimodal learning,  surgical video segmentation, and diffusion-based super-resolution. I have published 14+ papers in collaboration with hospital, biology, and anthropology labs, and mentored 5+ students who went on to publish and secure industry roles. I hold an M.S. degree in CSE from the University of Notre Dame, a B.S. degree in Computer Science, and a B.S. degree in Mathematics from the University of Southern Mississippi.

I am currently searching for 2026 Full-Time Roles. 😊
